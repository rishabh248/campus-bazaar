# Campus Bazaar - IIITDM Jabalpur Marketplace ðŸ›’

A full-stack web application built for students of IIITDM Jabalpur to easily buy and sell used items within the campus community. It aims to replace scattered WhatsApp groups with a dedicated, trusted platform.

## Purpose

The primary goal of Campus Bazaar is to provide a secure and user-friendly marketplace exclusive to IIITDMJ students. It facilitates direct connections between buyers and sellers for items like books, electronics, furniture, cycles, and other campus necessities.

## Key Features

* **Student-Only Access:** Registration requires a valid IIITDMJ email matching the format `<year><branch><rollno>@iiitdmj.ac.in`.
* **Product Listings:** Sellers can easily create listings with titles, descriptions, prices, categories, conditions, and upload up to 5 images per item via Cloudinary.
* **Browsing & Filtering:** Users can browse all available items, search using keywords, filter by category (Electronics, Books, Furniture, Vehicles, Other), and sort by date or price.
* **Interest & Contact:** Buyers can express interest in a product, notifying the seller and then revealing the seller's contact details (name, email, phone) to facilitate offline transactions.
* **In-App Chat:** A real-time chat feature allows interested buyers and sellers to communicate directly within the platform using Socket.IO.
* **User Dashboard:**
    * **Sellers:** View and manage their own listings (edit details, mark as sold, delete). See who has shown interest.
    * **Buyers:** Keep track of items they have shown interest in.
* **Notifications:** Sellers receive notifications when a buyer shows interest in their product.
* **Admin Panel:** Designated admins (based on email in environment variables) have access to a panel to view all users and products, delete any user or product, and mark products as "featured."
* **Featured Listings:** Featured products are highlighted on the homepage for better visibility.
* **Dark Mode:** Users can toggle between light and dark themes, with the preference saved locally.
* **Responsive Design:** The interface adapts smoothly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
